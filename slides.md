## OSI Model

---
class: center, middle

![OSI Model Simple](assets/images/osi-simple.png)

---
class: center, middle

OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a *conceptual* framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

---
class: center, middle

OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.

---
class: center, middle

In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

---
class: center, middle

Layers in the OSI model are ordered from â€‹the lowest layer to highest. Together, these layers comprise the OSI stack. The stack contains seven layers in two groups!

---

### Upper Layers

OSI designates the Application, Presentation, and Session stages of the stack as the upper layers. Generally speaking, software in these layers perform application-specific functions like data formatting, encryption, and connection management.

7: Application

6: Presentation

5: Session

---

### Lower Layers

The remaining lower layers of the OSI model provide more primitive network-specific functions like routing, addressing, and flow control.

4: Transport

3: Network

2: Data Link

1: Physical

---
class: center, middle

### Physical Layer (Layer 1)

---
class: center, middle

Lowest layer of the OSI Model is concerned with electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of the receiving device.

---

Specifications such as:

- voltages

- pin layout

- cabling

- radio frequencies

---

Functions of the physical layer are:

- Bit synchronization

- Bit rate control

- Physical topologies

- Transmission mode

---

"physical" resources such as

- network hubs

- cabling

- repeaters

- network adapters

- modems

---
class: center, middle

### Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

---
class: center, middle

In Data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames.

---
class: center, middle

Data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.

---

Two sub-layers:

- Media Access Control (MAC)

- Logical Link Control (LLC)

---
class: center, middle

*MAC* provides flow control and multiplexing for device transmissions over a network.

---
class: center, middle

*LLC*, provides flow and error control over the physical medium as well as identifies line protocols.

---
class: center, middle

The packet received from Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of NIC (Network Interface Card).

---
class: center, middle

The Receiverâ€™s MAC address is obtained by placing an *ARP*.

---

Functions of the Data Link layer are:

- Framing

- Physical addressing

- Error control

- Flow Control

- Access control

---
class: center, middle

### Network Layer (Layer 3)

---
class: center, middle

Responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations based on the addresses contained inside the frame.

---
class: center, middle

Network layer finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet protocol).

---
class: center, middle

At this layer, *routers* & *switches* are a crucial component used to quite literally route information where it needs to go between networks.

---

Functions of the Network layer are:

- Routing

- Logical Addressing

---
class: center, middle

### Transport Layer (Layer 4)

---
class: center, middle

Transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets.

---

Regulates

- size

- sequencing

- and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts

---

Functions of the transport layer are:

- Segmentation and Reassembly

- Service Point Addressing

---

Services provided by the transport layer:

- Connection Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process which include

  â€“ Connection Establishment

  â€“ Data Transfer

  â€“ Termination / disconnection

- Connection less service

---
class: center, middle

### Session Layer (Layer 5)

---
class: center, middle

Session layer controls the conversations between different computers.

---
class: center, middle

A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include authentication and reconnections.

---

Functions of the session layer are:

- Session establishment, maintenance and termination

- Synchronization

- Dialog Controller

---
class: center, middle

### Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

---
class: center, middle

Presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts.

---
class: center, middle

also called the *syntax* layer

---

Functions of the presentation layer are:

- Translation

- Encryption/ Decryption

---
class: center, middle

### Application Layer (Layer 7)

---
class: center, middle

At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application.

---
class: center, middle

Application layer identifies communication partners, resource availability, and synchronizes communication.

---

Functions of the Application layer are:

- Network Virtual Terminal

- *FTAM-File transfer* access and management

- Mail Services

- Directory Services

---
class: center, middle

![OSI Data Model](assets/images/osi-data-model.jpg)

---
class: center, middle

OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented in the Internet because of its late invention. Current model being used is the *TCP/IP* model.

---
class: center, middle

## Local installation & Setup

---
class: center, middle

## Internet protocol suite

---
class: center, middle

Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

---

Four abstraction layers:

- Link Layer

- Internet Layer

- Transport Layer

- Application Layer

---
class: center, middle

![OSI IP](assets/images/osi-ip.gif)

---
class: center, middle

The end-to-end principle has evolved over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.

---
class: center, middle

The robustness principle states: "In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. That is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical errors where the meaning is still clear)."

---
class: center, middle

"The second part of the principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features."

---
class: center, middle

Encapsulation is used to provide abstraction of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with the division of the protocol suite into layers of general functionality. In general, an application (the highest level of the model) uses a set of protocols to send its data down the layers. The data is further encapsulated at each level.

---
class: center, middle

### Application Layer aka Layer 7

---
class: center, middle

Application layer is the scope within which applications, or processes, create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another or the same host.

---

- Applications make use of the services provided by the underlying lower layers, especially the transport layer which provides reliable or unreliable pipes to other processes.

- Communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the clientâ€“server model and peer-to-peer networking.

---
class: center, middle

This is the layer in which all application protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate. Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent services.

---
class: center, middle

*Demo*: Simple client/server application

---
class: center, middle

### Transport Layer aka Layer 4

---
class: center, middle

Transport layer performs host-to-host communications on either the local network or remote networks separated by routers.

---
class: center, middle

It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications.

---
class: center, middle

UDP is the basic transport layer protocol, providing an unreliable connectionless datagram service.

---
class: center, middle

Transmission Control Protocol provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of data.

---
class: center, middle

#### TCP vs UDP

---

- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol.

- The speed for TCP is slower while the speed of UDP is faster

- TCP uses handshake protocol like SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK while UDP uses no handshake protocols

- TCP does error checking and also makes error recovery, on the other hand, UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets.

- TCP has acknowledgment segments, but UDP does not have any acknowledgment segment.
When we compare TCP vs UDP protocol, TCP is heavy-weight, and UDP is lightweight.

---
class: center, middle

![TCP vs UDP](assets/images/tcp-vs-udp.png)

---
class: center, middle

*Demo*: Echo TCP/UDP Server

---
class: center, middle

### Internet Layer aka Layer 3

---
class: center, middle

Internet layer exchanges datagrams across network boundaries. It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network connections.

---
class: center, middle

It is therefore also the layer that establishes internetworking.

---
class: center, middle

It defines and establishes the Internet.

---
class: center, middle

Defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite.

---
class: center, middle

The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines IP addresses. Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next host that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.

---
class: center, middle

*Demo*: IP Sockets

---
class: center, middle

*Related*: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

---
class: center, middle

### Link Layer

---
class: center, middle

The link layer defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers.

---
class: center, middle

This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to affect the transmission of Internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.

---
class: center, middle

*Related*: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

---
class: center, middle

MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator.

---
class: center, middle

Duplicate MAC Addresses separated by one or more routers is not a problem since the two devices wonâ€™t see each other and will use the router to communicate.

---
class: center, middle

![IP OSI](assets/images/osi-model-7-layers.jpg)

---
class: center, middle

Let's zoom into the Internet Layer... Specifically Addressing...

---
class: center, middle

## IP Addressing

---
class: center, middle

### IPAM (IP Address Management)

---
class: center, middle

IPAM (IP Address Management) is the administration of DNS and DHCP, which are the network services that assign and resolve IP addresses to machines in a TCP/IP network.

---
class: center, middle

Simply put, IPAM is a means of planning, tracking, and managing the Internet Protocol address space used in a network.

---
class: center, middle

Most commonly, tools such as DNS and DHCP are used in tandem to perform this task, though true IPAM will glue these services together so that each is aware of changes in the other (for instance DNS knowing of the IP address taken by a client via DHCP, and updating itself accordingly).

---
class: center, middle

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

---
class: center, middle

Eliminates the need for individually configuring network devices manually.

---
class: center, middle

### IPv4

---
class: center, middle

`IPv4` uses a 32-bit address space...

---
class: center, middle

... which provides 4,294,967,296 (2Ë†32) unique addresses.

---
class: center, middle

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

---
class: center, middle

Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is a set of Internet protocol (IP) standards that is used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices.

---

#### CIDR Refresher

- 10.0.0.0/8

- 192.168.0.0/16

- 172.16.0.0/12

- 169.254.0.0/16

What do these values mean?

---
class: center, middle

A subnetwork or *subnet* is a logical subdivision of an IP network.

---
class: center, middle

`IPv4` reserves special address blocks for private networks (~18 million addresses) and multicast addresses (~270 million addresses).

---
class: center, middle

A multicast address enables a device to send a datagram to a specified set of hosts, known as a multicast group, in different subnetworks.

---
class: center, middle

The multicast addresses are in the range `224.0.0.0` through `239.255.255.255`.

---

##### Private IPv4 ranges

- **10.0.0.0/8**

- **192.168.0.0/16**

- **172.16.0.0/12**

---

*DHCP* consists of two network components:

- a centrally installed network DHCP server

- client instances of the protocol stack on each computer or device

---
class: center, middle

DHCP services exist for networks running Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), as well as version 6 (IPv6). The IPv6 version of the DHCP protocol is commonly called DHCPv6.

---
class: center, middle

### NAT (Network address translation)

---
class: center, middle

allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address

---

- Hiding internal IP addresses from public knowledge

- Converting an IP address for an internal host into a different IP address

- Making the IP addresses of two different networks compatible

---

- Static (map) NAT

- Masquerade (hide) NAT

- Masquerade (port-mapped) NAT

---
class: center, middle

Static (map) network address translation (NAT) provides a one-to-one mapping of private IP addresses to public IP addresses. It allows you to map an IP address on your internal network to an IP address that you want to make public.

---
class: center, middle

Masquerade (hide) network address translation (NAT) enables you to hide the actual address of a personal computer private. NAT routes traffic from your personal computer to your system, which essentially makes the system the gateway for your personal computer.

---
class: center, middle

In port-mapped NAT, you can specify both the IP address and the port number to translate. This enables both your internal personal computer and the external workstation to initiate IP traffic. You can use port-mapped NAT if the external workstation (or client) needs to access workstations or systems inside your network. Only IP traffic that matches both the IP address and the port number is allowed to access.

---
class: center, middle

### IPv6

---
class: center, middle

`IPv6` uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2Ë†128, or approximately 3.4Ã—1038 addresses.

---
class: center, middle

`IPv6` addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four hexadecimal digits.

---
class: center, middle

### DNS

---
class: center, middle

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names.

---
class: center, middle

Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

---
class: center, middle

#### DNS server

---
class: center, middle

#### Record types

---

- A (Host address)

- AAAA (IPv6 host address)

- ALIAS (Auto resolved alias)

- CNAME (Canonical name for an alias)

- MX (Mail eXchange)

- NS (Name Server)

- PTR (Pointer)

- SOA (Start Of Authority)

- SRV (location of service)

- TXT (Descriptive text)

---
class: center, middle

And these were just the more common ones!

.content-credits[https://simpledns.plus/help/dns-record-types]

---

The 8 steps in a DNS lookup:

- A user types â€˜example.comâ€™ into a web browser and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a DNS recursive resolver.

- The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).

- The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward the .com TLD.

- The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.

- The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domainâ€™s nameserver, example.com.

- Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domainâ€™s nameserver.

- The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.

- The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.

class: center, middle

## IP Routing

---
class: center, middle

IP Routing is an umbrella term for the set of protocols that determine the path that data follows in order to travel across multiple networks from its source to its destination.

---

- Data is routed from its source to its destination through a series of routers, and across multiple networks.

- The IP Routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with next hop addresses.

---

These protocols include:

- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- IS-IS (Intermediate System - Intermediate System)

- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

---
class: center, middle

When an IP packet is to be forwarded, a router uses its forwarding table to determine the next hop for the packet's destination address, and forwards the packet appropriately.
